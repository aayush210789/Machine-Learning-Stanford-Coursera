%COMPUTECENTROIDS returns the new centroids by computing the means of the 
%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);
sum =0.0;
count =0.0;
for i =1 : K
    for j = 1:size(idx)
        if(idx(j) ==i)
        sum =sum+X(j,:);
        count = count+1;
        end
    end
    centroids(i,:) = sum/count;
    count =0;
    sum =0;
end
%         for k = 1:K
%             centroids(k,:) = mean(X(find(idx == k),:));
%         end
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
